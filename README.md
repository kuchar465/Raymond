# Raymond
Example implementation of Raymond Algorithm, written in java, using nodes to simulate processes.

In this example, you can build your own tree for testing by using this line in main function.\
R.setParentAndRequest(NODE, PARENT, isnodeRequesting?)

NODE (INTIGER) - node that we are currently connecting to the tree\
Parent (INTIGER)- node which will become parent of node mentioned above\
isnodeRequesting? (BOOLEAN) - this will tell the system if that node will request token.
